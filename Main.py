# Main program, will utilise the other subsystems together

#Process will be as follows:
    #loop for all pairs of images (first get it working for one then repeat for all in input folder)(
        #preprocess with B3MD (top and bottom)

        #Generate point clouds with DepthAnythingV2 and scale them using a reference object in frame (top and bottom)

        #run segmentation algorithm YOLO(top and bottom)

        #merge point clouds with segmentation algorithm (top and bottom)

        #merge top and bottom coordinate frames (rotation and translation)

        #reproject into each perspective (top and bottom)

        #write point cloud and segmentations to output folder
    #)end loop

    #have something here to compare the original segmentations with the ones this program has created

#Assumptions:
    
    #needs a trained segmentation algorithm

    #will need a way to compare to segmentation algorithm alone

    # images need an object of known size to exist within it to be able to determine scale
